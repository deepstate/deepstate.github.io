      <h1>The Elites</h1>
	  <p>
		Today's central banks create money out of thin air. Prior to 1971, the dollar was based on the gold standard. But it was U.S. President Nixon
		who removed the dollar to the gold standard which means that the banks can create money out of fiat.
	  </p>
	  <p>But who owns much of the world's central banks?</p>
	  <p>The answer, off course, are the financial and corporate elites. Because they can print money out of thin air, they have an abundance of it. And with
		money comes power. However, power corrupts. And absolute power corrupts absolutely. In the succeeding sections one will see how far
		their corruption goes.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		The elites control the nations' finances and governments. They wage war, in some cases fund both sides and profit from it.
		They are very shrewd and opportunistic not wanting a crisis go to waste. 
	  </p>
	  <p><b>Luciferians</b></p>
	  <p>They also engage in a not very mainstream religion. According to Ronald Bernard, a Dutch financial elite, most of those who are
		at the top actually engage in child sacrifice.</p>

	  <p>
		But this egregious proclivity of the elites are not only confined in Europe. The global elites are a very small "club" compared to
		the billions of earth's inhabitants. According to Mr. Bernard there are approximately 3,000 of them at the very top. The most
		concerning issue is that the majority of them are into abusing children. And because they have all the money in the world, they
		can buy the apparatus that would ensure that their practices are neverfully known. Or should word come out, that their apparatus
		can buy their way out.

		This apparatus is briefly described by Ted Gunderson, a former head of the FBI. In his speech, he briefly touched
		about missing children and that there is a Satanic syndicate that "everybody refuses to investigate." A more detailed
		discourse about this syndicate - or high-level pedophile rings - is describe in the Deep State page (coming soon).
	  </p>
	  <p>
		The way this apparatus works is that it creates control files for the elites by compromising individuals in echelons of power.
		These control files ensures that the elites are protected should word of their misdeeds come out. In this video, Mr. Gunderson
		narrates his investigation and describes the scope and extent of this syndicate. Its purview reaches up to the White House.

	  <p>
		This Luciferian/Satanic syndicate has been vetted by a former Navy SEAL, Craig Sawyer. According to his sources from the
		intelligence community, the elites, through their corporate outfits, are indeed engaged in such deplorable and disgusting activities.
		He describes them as high-level pedophile rings.

	  <p><b>World War II</b></p>

	  <p><b>Financial Crisis</b></p>
	  <p>
		
	  </p>
	  <p><b>John F. Kennedy</b></p>
	  <p>
		So although the Elites can dictate the outcome of major crisis which they themselves created, they don't have
		total control on the votes of the masses. And it is with this issue that the Elites needed an apparatus to which
		they can rely on should the votes of the masses do not go their way.
