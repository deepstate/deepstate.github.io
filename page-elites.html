      <h1>The Elites</h1>
	  <p>
		Today's central banks create money out of thin air. Prior to 1971, the dollar was based on the gold standard. But it was U.S. President Nixon
		who removed the dollar to the gold standard which means that the banks can create money out of fiat.
	  </p>
	  <p>But who owns much of the world's central banks?</p>
	  <p>The answer, off course, are the financial elites. Because they can print money out of thin air, they have an abundance of it. And with
		money comes power. However, power corrupts. And absolute power corrupts absolutely. In the succeeding sections one will see how far
		their corruption goes.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		The elites control the nations' finances and governments. They wage war and profit from it.
		They are very shrewd and opportunistic not wanting a crisis go to waste.

	  <p><b>Luciferians</b></p>
	  <p>They also engage in a not very maintream religion.</p>

		So although the Elites can dictate the outcome of major crisis which they themselves created, they don't have
		total control on the votes of the masses. And it is with this issue that the Elites needed an apparatus to which
		they can rely on should the votes of the masses do not go their way.
